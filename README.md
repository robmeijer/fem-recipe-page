## My process
### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
Getting more familiar with using nested CSS.

### Continued development
Spent a lot of time extracting as much unique CSS as I could to avoid duplication across multiple sections.

Would like to look at using this approach from the start, rather than cleaning up afterwards.

### Useful resources
- [Kevin Powell's YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob)\
  Kevin is an amazing teacher, and I based my solution on his many excellent examples.
